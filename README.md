# STM32-BMP388

This project is a firmware implementation for integrating the BMP388 high-precision barometric pressure sensor with an STM32 microcontroller. The system acquires real-time pressure and temperature data to derive accurate altitude estimations via the barometric formula.

### `BMP388 Barometric Pressure & Temperature Sensor`

The BMP388 is a high-precision barometric pressure sensor developed by Bosch Sensortec. By measuring both atmospheric pressure and temperature within a single package, the sensor is specifically used for altitude estimation and embedded system applications. It can be easily integrated with STM32-based systems via `$I^2C$` and `$SPI$` interfaces.
