### `BMP388 Barometric Pressure & Temperature Sensor`

The BMP388 is a high-performance, 24-bit digital barometric pressure sensor from Bosch Sensortec. Integrating pressure and temperature sensing into a single module, it is optimized for accurate altitude tracking and embedded designs. The sensor offers seamless integration with STM32 microcontrollers through standard $I^2C$ and $SPI$ communication protocols.
